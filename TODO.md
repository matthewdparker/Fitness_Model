# To Do

- Modify parse_xml to accommodate workouts where gps was off (e.g. treadmill/bike trainer)

- Modify parse_xml and/or calculate_stats to:
    - Identify moving times (vs. stationary times)
    - Only increment time in zones/elevation/etc. when moving


- Consider exponentially down-weighting training loads from older activities (at different rates) for both fitness and fatigue calculations

- Consider structure of convoluting cardio and activity-specific values; is this even necessary?
